REMEMBER: TEST CODE AFTER EVERY CHANGE

- VSS = 0 (?). Need differences between SP and EEV 
    - Increase lead time  -> Road + NordNorge Banen STEFFEN
    - change emission target (zero in 2050)         STEFFEN
    - extra investment opportunities
        - hydrogen/ammonia infrastructure           STEFFEN
    - Constrain the capacity expansion of charging infrastructure
        - first have a look at how much is being build out

- Investment costs  -> split the charging infrastructure costs (hydrogen, BET, biofuels)    STEFFEN

- Write scripts for experiments
    - Sensitivity analysis for decarbonization targets
