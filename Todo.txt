REMEMBER: TEST CODE AFTER EVERY CHANGE

- VSS = 0 (?). Need differences between SP and EEV 
    - Increase lead time                    STEFFEN
    - Add uncertainty in t_0 (maturity)     DONE
    - change emission target (zero in 2050) STEFFEN
    - last resort: extra investment opportunities
        - hydrogen/ammonia infrastructure 
        - hydrogen trucks filling infrastructure 


- Add numbers to edge plot          RUBEN

- Change years to 2022, 2026, 2030, ... RUBEN 
    - Change data files 
    - Change T_TIME_PERIODS 
    - Change in plotting 

- Scenario names: pessimistic, base, optimistic

- Debug risk aversion (no difference between Expectation and CVaR?)
    - check risk code           RUBEN
        - klein test model

- We get this warning: "Warning: Model contains large matrix coefficient range"
    - Can we fix this?

- Write scripts for experiments
    - Sensitivity analysis for decarbonization targets
