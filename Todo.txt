REMEMBER: TEST CODE AFTER EVERY CHANGE

- VSS = 0 (?). Need differences between SP and EEV 
    - Increase lead time  -> Road + NordNorge Banen STEFFEN
    - change emission target (zero in 2050)         STEFFEN
    - extra investment opportunities
        - hydrogen/ammonia infrastructure           STEFFEN
    - technology development                        RUBEN

- network plot -> legend

- Debug risk aversion (no difference between Expectation and CVaR?)
    - check risk code                               RUBEN
        - klein test model

- Write scripts for experiments
    - Sensitivity analysis for decarbonization targets
