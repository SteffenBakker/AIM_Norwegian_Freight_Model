This file contains an overview of all the data files. 
For every data file (.csv or .xlsx) we indicate what data it contains
This will be used to make new, "clean" data files

I discuss the files in order of appearance in the data reading file "ConstructData.py"
After the file name I indicate the corresponding file name in the cleaned up version of the data (see temp folder "Reorganized")

1. "pwc_riktig" ---> "demand.csv"
Demand data. For every
- OD pair
- commodity
- year (2020, 2025, 2030, 2040, 2050) (some hardcoding going on here)
it shows the yearly demand in tonnes
The data is based on estimates from NGM


2. "zonal_aggregation_steffen.csv" ---> "zonal_aggregation.csv"
Indicates how the zones are constructed
For every "NTP" zone (?) it indicates:
- The corresponding "Steffen zone"
- The corresponding "AIM zone"
- Corresponding topographical data (latitude/longitude)


3. "Ferdig - cap + invest.xlsx" ---> "capacities_and_investments.xlsx"
Rail and sea capacities and investment possibilities

a. Sheet "Cap rail"
Capacities of rail lines (in tonnes per year)
Capacities of rail terminals (in tonnes per year)

b. Sheet "Invest rail"
Possible capacity investments in rail lines:
- capacity increase amount 
- capacity after investment 
- cost of investment 
Possible upgrade investments in rail lines:
- cost of electrifying
- cost of partial electrifying
Possible investments in rail terminals:
- capacity increase amount
- cost of investment

c. Sheet "Invest sea" ---> moved to d.
Possible capacity investments in sea terminals:
- capacity increase amount 
- cost of investment
(also contains the capacity of the harbours)

d. Sheet "Cap sea" (NOT USED) ---> moved to c.
Capacities of sea terminals (in tonnes per year)


4. "all_generated_paths.csv" ---> "generated_paths.csv"
List of generated paths, consisting of lists of (arc (i.e., i,j), mode, route)


5. "Avstander (1).xlsx" ---> "distances.xlsx"
Distances between nodes per mode

a. Sheet "Sea"
Distances by sea (for all sea arcs)

b. Sheet "Road"
Distances by road (for all road arcs)

c. Sheet "Rail"
Distances by rail (for all rail arcs)


6. "Costs.xlsx" ---> "transport_costs_emissions.xlsx"
Overview of transport costs and related data

a. "Costs"
For every vehicle type, fuel, year: 
- cost per Tkm 
- emissions per Tkm 
- corresponding CO2 fee

b. .... (NOT USED) ---> (removed)


7. "DATA_INPUT.xlsx" ---> (sheets moved to various other files)

a. Sheet "Main" (NOT USED) ---> (removed)
...

b. Sheet "EmissionCap" ---> "emission_cap.xlsx", sheet "emission_cap"
Emission budget per year in the planning horizon
Differentiated in reduction levels: 100%, 75%, 73%, 70%, 35%_70%

c. Sheet "TransferCosts" ---> "transport_costs_emissions.xslx", sheet "transfer_costs"
Transfer costs per product type and transfer type (mode m1 to mode m2)


8. "charging_data.xlsx" ---> "capacities_and_investments.xlsx", sheet "Invest road"
Data relevant for charging stations
Specifically, for every road fuel that needs charging infrastructure:
- maximum distance between stations
- trucks that can be filled per day by a station 
- cost of a station

9. "NY Maturities, 27 scenarios.csv" ---> "scenarios_maturities_27.csv"
Maturity levels corresponding to all scenarios
Specifically, a percentage for each mode-fuel, year and scenario

(10. "Instance_results_with_data/Instance3/...)
(only used if VSS==True, but VSS is set to False)
(also, this folder has been renamed, so the code doesn't work now)


TODO: check how file "best_multimode_paths" is used
